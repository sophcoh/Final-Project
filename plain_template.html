  <p> It seems as if America is almost desensitized when a story breaks about another mass shooting. Since 2009, there have been about <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/maps/mass-shootings-in-america/" target="blank_">271 mass shootings</a> in the United States and little work has been done to curb the number of deaths from firearms. While mass shootings are often reported and written about across the media, the amount of single fatalities from firearms has been growing in the past 41 years.</p>

  <p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported <a href="https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/" target="blank_">on deaths from firearms</a> from 1981 to 2019. The data shows that from 1999 to 2019 there was close to a 39% increase in firearm deaths and males disproportionately die from firearms compared to females. The dataset focused on firearm deaths by homicide, suicide, unintentional deaths, legal intervention, and undermined deaths. Out of all these categories, suicide is the leading cause of death by firearm. People are 55.60% more likely to die of suicide by a firearm than any other type of death listed in the dataset.</p>

  <p>It is hard to contextualize a dataset that spans over 38 years and has many potholes. Alice Ellyson, an acting assistant professor and research faculty affiliate in the injury and policy research program at the University of Washington, and Frederick Rivara, an adjunct professor in the department of epidemiology who focuses on the epidemiology of firearm injuries at the University of Washington, spoke about the trends they have seen regarding death and violence from firearms.</p>

  <p>Rivara has looked at homeownership of guns and researched how owning a gun in a home increases the risk of homicide and suicide occurring in that home.</p>

  <p>“More recently I have looked at protection orders and the characteristics of those getting a hold of guns,” Rivara said. “I have also done work looking at the association of drunk driving laws and firearms deaths so really a wide variety of things.”</p>

    <p>Ellyson’s research focuses on interpersonal violence and intimate partner violence which includes the use of firearms. Ellyson shared that she has always been interested in all types of violence that adolescents and young adults experience and how that relates to health risk behaviors that are already present in someone’s life.</p>

    <p>“Firearm death and violence comes into play a lot with intimate partner violence so that's where most of my expertise lies,” Ellyson said. “But, I also have other publications looking at firearm suicides as well.”</p>

    <p>Rivara explained how datasets about firearm fatalities are relatively new because of the Dickey Amendment on federal funding for research on gun violence. In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993413/" target="blank_">1996 Congress</a> passed the Dickey Amendment to begin treating gun violence as a public health issue. The National Rifle Association accused the CDC of being biased against the right to own guns and began lobbying for research to stop being funded. In March 2018, Congress passed a $1.3 trillion spending bill to allow research related to gun violence and ownership to begin again.</p>

    <p>The published CDC data about firearms align with the trends that Rivara and Ellyson have seen in their studies. Both of them noted the importance of acknowledging the many limitations of this dataset.</p>

    <p>“One limitation of the data is that they are probably only using sex instead of gender identity which is something to consider when looking at the trends between males and females,” Ellyson said. “The kinds of firearm deaths that people experience can also be different depending on what type of firearm was used.”</p>

    <p>“There are actually quite a lot of deaths from suicides and homicides and the media doesn’t really focus on it, they focus on things that make news like mass shootings, but a lot of firearm deaths occur each day.” </p>

    <p> Both Ellyson, Rivara, and the CDC data reported that males experience more fatalities from firearm deaths than females. The dataset shows that roughly 24,000 more males have died from firearms than females from 1981 to 2019.</p>

    <p>Rivara spoke about how men are usually more aggressive than women when it comes to acts of violence, alcohol consumption, and the likelihood to purchase a firearm which increases the risk of gun death.</p>

    <p>“Females are more likely to commit suicide but males are more likely to die from suicide because they use firearms to commit suicide,” Rivara said. “You are going to die about 90% of the time if you use that method.”</p>

    <p>Similarly, Ellyson also shared that males disproportionately experience firearm deaths compared to females, “86% of all people who die from firearms are male and that’s actually true of non-fatal firearm injuries as well.”</p

<p>Rivara stressed the importance of understanding the two leading ways people die from firearms, which include homicide and suicide. He shared that 60% of firearm deaths are suicides and in some states like Washington, where Rivara lives and performs his research, 75% of all fatalities from firearms are suicides.</p>

<p>“There are actually quite a lot of deaths from suicides and homicides and the media doesn’t really focus on it, they focus on things that make news like mass shootings, but a lot of firearm deaths occur each day.”</p>

<p>Similarly, Ellyson also shared that males disproportionately experience firearm deaths compared to females, “86% of all people who die from firearms are male and that’s actually true of non-fatal firearm injuries as well.” Ellyson and Rivara believe that there are multiple reasons that contribute to the increase in firearm deaths from 1981 to the present. Rivara explained that within his department, no one quite knows why there has been such a big increase.</p>

<p>“When the pandemic started there was a big increase in sales of firearms and I think the reason I bought firearms was the fear of self-protection,” Rivara said.</p>

<p>The increase in ownership of guns, the pandemic, and fear of self-protection are examples of why Ellyson believes there has been an uptick in suicides and homicides from firearms.</p>

<p>“The two biggest types of death are suicide and homicide from firearms and because they are so different in terms of what we think leads to those two types, there are probably a set of factors that are contributing to both as well as factors that are contributing individually,” Ellyson said.</p>
